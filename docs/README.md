Welcome to the Physiotherapy Ankle Sprain Assessment Project!

Physiotherapy is on the cusp of having electronic health records, and yet there has been little concrete progress. Jamila Chihab is a physiotherapist who is now studying for an MSc in Health Informatics at University College London, and her project is trying to change this lack of progress.

We now have the technology to bring physiotherapy into the modern age of data collection, and the aim of the  project is to identify a standards-based method for physiotherapy documentation in an electronic format. Expert engagement from physiotherapists and clinical modellers in reviewing and commenting on the dataset which underpins the project will be invaluable as part of working towards an electronic health records system for physiotherapy.

Using the ankle sprain injury as an example, Jamila has extracted the specific clinical data from a guideline and created a dataset. With the help of industry technical experts she has specified how these data should be captured, stored and recorded.

The next step is to ask for expert views about these data structures and their fitness for use.
